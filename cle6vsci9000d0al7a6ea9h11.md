# A frustrating end to debugging my silly error in Python

Hey guys! I love coding. I think it's so cool to be able to make computers do whatever you want. But sometimes, things don't go as planned.

In this blog post, I'm going to talk about what it's like to debug Python code and share my own frustrating experience.

* ### About the Project
    

I was working on a project that involved connecting to an API and getting some data. I thought I had everything figured out, but then I got an error message that made me go crazy.

* ### About the Error
    

The error message was not very helpful, and it was like this: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'status_code'`

This error message was not very informative, and I didn't know where to start looking for the root cause of the issue. I first went to the internet to know why Attribute Error occurs. It was my first time facing this error ðŸ˜•

* ### What did I do?
    

I started by going through the code line by line, trying to find the source of the problem. I checked the API documentation, re-read the code, and even tried to Google the error message. However, I still couldn't find the root cause of the problem. It was like I was hitting a brick wall and couldn't figure out what was wrong ðŸ˜‘ðŸ’¢

As time went on, I started getting more and more frustrated. I had been working on this for hours, and I still had no idea what was going on. I started to feel like I was wasting my time and getting nowhere.

**I decided to quit the project after wasting half the day sorting the error. I got hopeless.**

* ### New Day, New Motivation and the Error Sorted!
    

I came back again to the project, I decided to try a different approach this time. I started removing parts of the code to see if I could isolate the problem.

**And you know what?** **It worked! âš¡ðŸ‘€**

I removed a section of the code that I thought might be causing the issue, and the error message disappeared. That's when I realized that the problem wasn't with the code or the API - it was with the data that was being returned. So I updated my code to handle that scenario, and the problem was solved.

* ### Conclusion
    

Wow, that was quite an adventure! Debugging Python can be tough, but it's also really rewarding when you finally figure out what's going on.

I hope you guys enjoyed my story and learned something from it.
