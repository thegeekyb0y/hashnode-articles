## Introduction to Divide and Conquer Algorithm

Divide and conquer is a popular **algorithmic paradigm** that involves **breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems**, solving each sub-problem independently, and **then combining the solutions to the sub-problems to produce the final solution** to the original problem.

### 3 key steps of Divide and Conquer Algorithm

1. **Divide**: The problem is divided into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently. This step usually involves breaking the problem into two or more sub-problems of roughly equal size.
    
2. **Conquer**: Each sub-problem is solved independently using recursion or other techniques. This step is where the actual work is done to solve the problem.
    
3. **Combine**: The solutions to the sub-problems are combined to form the solution to the original problem. This step usually involves merging the solutions to the sub-problems together.

## Applications of Divide and Conquer Algorithm

Divide and Conquer is a versatile problem-solving strategy that can be applied to many different types of problems. Here are some common applications of Divide and Conquer:

### **Binary Search**

Binary Search is a search algorithm that is used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found. Here's how Binary Search works:

1. Divide: The search interval is divided in half.
    
2. Conquer: The algorithm checks whether the target value is in the left or right half of the search interval, and discards the other half.
    
3. Combine: The algorithm repeats the process on the remaining half until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.
    

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```

Binary Search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it a very efficient algorithm for searching sorted arrays.

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the input array into two halves, sorting each half separately, and then merging the sorted halves back together. Here's how Merge Sort works:

1. Divide: The input array is divided in half.
    
2. Conquer: Recursively sort each half of the input array using Merge Sort.
    
3. Combine: Merge the sorted halves back together to obtain the final sorted array.
    

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:]

    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(left, right)
```

Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input array into two partitions, one with elements smaller than a pivot element, and another with elements larger than the pivot element. Here's how Quick Sort works:

1. Divide: Choose a pivot element and divide the input array into two partitions based on the pivot element.
    
2. Conquer: Recursively sort each partition using Quick Sort.
    
3. Combine: Combine the sorted partitions to obtain the final sorted array.
    

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```

Quick Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, but can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) in certain cases.

### Maximum Subarray Sum

The Maximum Subarray Sum problem involves finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum. Here's how this problem can be solved using Divide and Conquer:

1. Divide: The array is divided in half.
    
2. Conquer: Recursively find the maximum subarray sum in the left and right sub-arrays.
    
3. Combine: Calculate the maximum subarray sum that includes the middle element and return the maximum of the three sums.
    

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return arr[0]

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_max = max_subarray_sum(arr[:mid])
    right_max = max_subarray_sum(arr[mid:])
    cross_max = max_crossing_sum(arr, mid)

    return max(left_max, right_max, cross_max)

def max_crossing_sum(arr, mid):
    left_sum = float('-inf')
    temp_sum = 0
    for i in range(mid - 1, -1, -1):
        temp_sum += arr[i]
        left_sum = max(left_sum, temp_sum)

    right_sum = float('-inf')
    temp_sum = 0
    for i in range(mid, len(arr)):
        temp_sum += arr[i]
        right_sum = max(right_sum, temp_sum)

    return left_sum + right_sum
```

The time complexity of Maximum Subarray Sum using Divide and Conquer is O(n log n).

Overall, the Divide and Conquer algorithm is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. By understanding the basic principles and applications of Divide and Conquer, you can tackle complex problems more efficiently and effectively.

## FAANG Interview Question solved using Divide and Conquer Algorithm

Question: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

Example: For the input array \[2, -3, 1, 5, -6, 9\], the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum is \[1, 5, -6, 9\], and the maximum sum is 9 + (-6) + 5 + 1 = 9.

Solution: This problem can be solved efficiently using the Divide and Conquer algorithm. We can recursively divide the input array into two halves, and find the maximum subarray sum in each half.

* The maximum subarray sum in the left half, right half, and the combined subarray containing the middle element can be computed in constant time.
    
* The maximum subarray sum in the combined subarray can be computed by finding the maximum subarray sum starting from the middle element, and the maximum subarray sum ending at the middle element, and adding them together. This can also be done in linear time.
    
* Here's the Python code to solve the problem using the Divide and Conquer algorithm:
    

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return arr[0]
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr[:mid])
    right_sum = max_subarray_sum(arr[mid:])
    
    # find the maximum subarray sum starting from the middle element
    left_max = arr[mid-1]
    temp_sum = 0
    for i in range(mid-1, -1, -1):
        temp_sum += arr[i]
        left_max = max(left_max, temp_sum)
    
    # find the maximum subarray sum ending at the middle element
    right_max = arr[mid]
    temp_sum = 0
    for i in range(mid, len(arr)):
        temp_sum += arr[i]
        right_max = max(right_max, temp_sum)
    
    # return the maximum subarray sum in the left half, right half, or combined subarray
    return max(left_sum, right_sum, left_max + right_max)
```
