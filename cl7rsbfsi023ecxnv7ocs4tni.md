## 1. Map Function
Map takes a function and a collection of items.
It makes a new, empty collection, runs the function on each item in the original collection and inserts each return value into the new collection.

## 2. Lambda Function

The idea of lambda function is to evaluate expressions easily.
The parameters of the lambda are defined to the left of the colon. The function body is defined to the right of the colon.

## 3. Complex Numbers

People dont usually focus on this topic, but python cmath has a variety of functions for this topic as well.
- If we want to write 2+3i as complex number in python, it would be written as 2+3j
- You can also define complex numbers using the complex() function
- We can also use “a.real” and “a.imag” to filter equation

## 4. Try.....Except.......Finally

The try block is used to check some code for errors.
Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the try block.
No matter what is exception, code inside finally is always executed.
